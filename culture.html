			<p>Bubble tea was rumored to be created by the product development manager, Ms. Lin Hsiu Hui, of a teahouse, Cun Shui Tang, because she was bored. She dropped fen yuan (sweetened tapioca pudding) into her Assam iced tea and the rest was history. This bubble tea invention became a new sensation and soon everyone was selling it.</p>
